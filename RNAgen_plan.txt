# RNAgen Overview

Goal: 
To have the following process 
- RNA seq 
	- taken from either a string
	- from miRBase id (ex. hsa-let-7a-1)
	- from miRBase Accession number (ex. MI0000060)
- N foldings of sequence
	- generated using RNAfold
	- takes in 
- Get represenations of foldings
	- dot bracket
	- 2 channel binary
	- 1 channel binary
	- 8 nucleotide rep? (unbonded A != bonded A)
- NxN distance matrix of the foldings
	- (leichenstein dist)
	- other distance matrices
- Clustering on distance matrix
	- diffusion maps
	- MDS
	- PHATE
- Compare PHATE plots between sequences
