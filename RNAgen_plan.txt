# RNAgen Overview - to be called RNAAnalysis 
# import RNAAnalysis as rnaa

Goal: 
To have the following process 
- RNA seq 
	- taken from either a string
	- from miRBase id (ex. hsa-let-7a-1) # later
	- from miRBase Accession number (ex. MI0000060) # later
- N foldings of sequence
	- can generate using RNAfold
	- can take in already generated structure from data # later
- Get represenations of foldings
	- dot bracket - default output from RNAfold
	- 2 channel binary
	- 1 channel binary
	- 8 nucleotide rep? (unbonded A != bonded A)
- NxN distance matrix of the foldings
	- (leichenstein dist)
	- other distance matrices
- Clustering on distance matrix
	- diffusion maps
	- MDS
	- PHATE
- Compare PHATE plots between sequences



# Classes

- SecStruct
	- takes in from Sequence
	- sequence
	- folding function with energy window
	- representations methods after folding
	- energies 
- Distance
	- takes in SecStruct class
	- sequence
	- distance metrics
		- returns matrices
