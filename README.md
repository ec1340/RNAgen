# RNAgen

### Workflow

1) Parse sequence from file

2) Generate secondary structure (RNAfold)

3) Transform secondary structures to dot bracket notation

- should also include options for other representation methods

4) Use L distances between the secondary structures generated

5) Using the produced distance matrix, run PHATE or diffusion maps
